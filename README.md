## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

1. **Git**: For cloning the repository.
2. **Docker**: Follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.
3. **Helm**: Install Helm by following the instructions [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
4. **Kubernetes**: Use Minikube for a local Kubernetes cluster. Install it by following the guide [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).
5. **ArgoCD**: Follow the [ArgoCD installation guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/) to deploy it on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rekapost/devopsified-cicd-docker-helm-argocd-k8s.git
   cd devopsified-cicd-docker-helm-argocd-k8s

Install Docker:
Follow the official Docker installation guide.
Verify the installation:

```bash
docker --version
Install Helm:

Follow the Helm installation guide.

Verify the installation:

```bash
helm version
Set up Kubernetes:

Use Minikube for a local Kubernetes cluster. Follow the Minikube installation guide.

Verify the setup:

```bash
kubectl version
Install ArgoCD:

Follow the ArgoCD installation guide.

Verify the installation:

```bash
argocd version
Usage
Building Docker Image
To build the Docker image for your application:

```bash
docker build -t <your_image_name>:<tag> .
Deploying with Helm
Use Helm to install the application on your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm install <release_name> ./helm
Syncing with ArgoCD
Once the application is deployed, you can use ArgoCD to manage the deployment:

```bash
argocd app sync <app_name>
Configuration
Docker Configuration
The Dockerfile in the root directory is used to build your Docker image. It is optimized for multi-stage builds to keep the image size minimal.

Helm Configuration
The helm/ directory contains the Helm charts used for deploying applications on Kubernetes. To customize the configuration for your environment, edit the values.yaml file.

ArgoCD Configuration
The ArgoCD configuration ensures that all changes pushed to the Git repository are automatically reflected in the Kubernetes cluster. The repository configuration can be customized either in the ArgoCD UI or via the CLI.

Deployment
Once your local setup is ready and the application is built, follow these steps to deploy your app:

Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.

ArgoCD will automatically detect changes in the repository and deploy the updated application to Kubernetes.
